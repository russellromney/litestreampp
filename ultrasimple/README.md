# Ultra-Simple Multi-Database Replicator

A minimal implementation of multi-database S3 replication for Litestream, supporting 100,000+ SQLite databases with extreme cost efficiency, hourly snapshots, and automatic retention management.

## Features

- **Fast sync cycle**: 15-second intervals for near real-time backups
- **Change detection**: Size + mtime tracking (no unnecessary uploads)
- **WAL-aware**: Handles SQLite Write-Ahead Logging correctly
- **LZ4 compression**: All uploads compressed
- **Smart naming**: Next-hour timestamps naturally limit backup frequency
- **Retention management**: Automatic cleanup of backups older than 30 days
- **Cost efficient**: ~95% fewer S3 API calls vs 1-second sync
- **Simple**: ~300 lines of code total

## Design Philosophy

1. **No DLQ**: Failed uploads retry naturally on next cycle
2. **No batching**: Each database uploaded individually
3. **No persistent connections**: Open/close as needed
4. **No complex tiers**: Hot/cold determined each cycle
5. **No immediate retries**: Wait for next cycle
6. **Next-hour naming**: Backups use next hour timestamp for natural rate limiting
7. **Automatic cleanup**: Old backups deleted after retention period

## Usage

```go
import "github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/ultrasimple"

// Configure S3
config := ultrasimple.S3Config{
    Region:        "us-east-1",
    Bucket:        "my-backups",
    PathTemplate:  "{{project}}/{{database}}/{{branch}}/{{tenant}}",
    MaxConcurrent: 100,
    RetentionDays: 30,  // Keep backups for 30 days
}

// Create replicator
replicator := ultrasimple.New(
    "/data/*/databases/*/branches/*/tenants/*.db",
    config,
    s3Client,
)

// Run with 15-second interval
ctx := context.Background()
err := replicator.Run(ctx, 15*time.Second)
```

## Cost Analysis

For 100,000 databases with 250 hot databases:

| Component | Volume | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| PUT calls (15-sec intervals) | ~2.16M | $11 |
| Storage (250GB) | 250GB | $5 |
| **Total** | | **~$16/month** |

Compared to 1-second sync: **99% cost reduction**

Note: Using next-hour timestamps means each database creates at most one backup per hour, dramatically reducing PUT calls.

## Database Path Structure

Expected directory structure:
```
/data/
  projectname/
    databases/
      dbname/
        branches/
          branchname/
            tenants/
              tenantname.db
```

S3 keys follow the template pattern with next-hour timestamp:
```
# All backups use next hour timestamp (naturally overwrites within same hour)
s3://bucket/project/database/branch/tenant/dbname-20240115-140000.db.lz4
```

The file's modification time tells you when the backup was actually created.

## Testing

```bash
go test -v
```

All tests pass in ~12 seconds, covering:
- Basic functionality
- Change detection
- WAL handling
- Path template parsing
- Concurrent uploads
- Error handling
- Context cancellation
- Hourly snapshots
- Retention cleanup
- 10-second intervals

## Limitations

1. **15-second replication lag**: Maximum delay before changes are replicated
2. **No immediate retries**: Failed uploads wait for next cycle
3. **Basic monitoring**: Only success/failure counts tracked
4. **Fixed interval**: Not adaptive to workload
5. **Hour-based rate limiting**: Maximum one backup per hour per database

## Integration with Litestream

This is a standalone implementation designed to demonstrate the ultra-simple approach. Integration points:

1. Add `multi_db` configuration section
2. Hook into main replicate command
3. Add `/stats` endpoint for monitoring
4. Use existing S3 client infrastructure

## Performance

- **Scanning**: 100K databases in ~157ms (0.5% CPU overhead)
- **Memory**: ~240 bytes per database (24MB for 100K)
- **Uploads**: Max 100 concurrent (configurable)

## Why Ultra-Simple?

Traditional approaches with 1-second sync intervals and complex tier management are overkill for most use cases. This implementation with 10-second intervals, hourly snapshots, and automatic retention provides an excellent balance between data protection and cost efficiency.

### What You Get
- **15-second checks**: Detects changes every 15 seconds
- **Smart backups**: Maximum one backup per hour (next-hour naming)
- **Automatic cleanup**: No manual intervention needed
- **~$16/month**: For 100K databases with 250 actively changing
