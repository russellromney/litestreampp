# Active Context - Litestream Multi-DB Implementation

## Current Session: Pattern-Based Recovery Implementation  
**Date**: 2025-08-07
**Status**: Completed basic implementation of restore-pattern command

### What Was Implemented:
1. **New `restore-pattern` command** (`cmd/litestream/restore_pattern.go`)
   - Restores multiple databases matching glob patterns
   - Parallel execution with configurable workers (default: 10)
   - Progress tracking with `-progress` flag
   - Support for `-output-dir` to restore to different location
   - `-if-db-not-exists` flag to skip existing databases

2. **Features Working:**
   - Config-based discovery (reads litestream.yml, filters by pattern)
   - Parallel restore using goroutines with semaphore
   - Basic progress output showing X/Y databases restored
   - Error handling that continues on failure
   - Pattern matching with standard glob syntax

3. **Testing:**
   - Created `test_restore_pattern.sh` with comprehensive tests
   - All tests passing for basic functionality
   - Verified parallel restore, pattern matching, output directory

### Enhanced Features Added:
1. **Wildcard Glob Support** 
   - Added doublestar library for ** pattern support
   - Can now use patterns like `/data/**/*.db` to match nested directories
   - Tested with complex directory structures

2. **Production S3 Discovery** ✅
   - Added `ListObjectsWithPrefix` method to `s3/replica_client.go`
   - Full pattern-based S3 discovery with wildcards
   - Supports patterns like `s3://bucket/backups/**/*.db`
   - Identifies Litestream backup structure automatically
   - Progress logging for large buckets (every 1000 objects)
   - Environment variable support for credentials and endpoints
   - Compatible with LocalStack, MinIO, and S3-compatible services

### Implementation Details:
- **S3 Client Access**: Added public method to ReplicaClient for listing objects
- **Pattern Matching**: Applies doublestar patterns to S3 keys
- **Database Detection**: Looks for `/generations/*/snapshots/` structure
- **Deduplication**: Tracks unique database paths to avoid duplicates
- **Authentication**: Supports AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, AWS_ENDPOINT
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of pattern errors, continues processing

### Still TODO (Future Enhancements):
- Resumability for interrupted restores
- Better progress bars/visualization
- Error report file generation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Dry-run mode for previewing operations

## Project Overview
Implementing multi-database support for Litestream to handle 100K+ SQLite databases with hot/cold tier management and S3 replication.

## Completed Work
### Phase 1-3 ✅
- Multi-database discovery and management
- Hot/cold tier system with write detection  
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Memory optimizations (96.6% reduction from 1.2GB to 41MB)
- Demo scripts testing 10K databases
- Template-based fast database creation (~9000 DBs/second)

### Known Issues
- S3 replication configured but not implemented (ReplicaTemplate set but no Replica objects created)
- Demos use disk storage at ~/.litestream-demos/ (not /tmp)
- LocalStack setup script created but S3 writes not active

## Current Tasks (Phase 4)
1. **Complete S3 Replication Integration** [DONE]
   - ✅ Created Replica instances from ReplicaTemplate
   - ✅ Start/stop replica sync with hot/cold transitions
   - ✅ Handle WAL streaming and snapshots
   - ✅ Fixed import cycles by using factory pattern

2. **Integration with Main Litestream Command** [IN PROGRESS]
   - Need to modify cmd/litestream/replicate.go
   - Add multi-db config detection
   - Inject S3 client creation function
   - Ensure backward compatibility

3. **Production Hardening**
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Retry logic for S3 failures
   - Comprehensive error handling

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Prometheus metrics already aggregated
   - Replication lag tracking
   - Health check endpoints

## Key Design Decisions
- Use lazy initialization for database connections
- Shared resource pools instead of per-DB resources
- Hot tier gets full Litestream features, cold tier minimal resources
- Template copying for fast database creation in demos

## Testing Strategy
- Run tests frequently during implementation
- Use LocalStack for S3 testing without AWS
- Test with both small (100) and large (10K) database counts
- Verify memory usage stays under targets

## Project Organization (After Consolidation)

### litestreampp/ Directory
All multi-database support code has been consolidated into the `litestreampp` package:

**Core Files:**
- `multidb_integrated.go` - Main integrated manager implementation ✅
- `hotcold_manager.go` - Manages hot/cold transitions with S3 replica support ✅
- `multidb_config.go` - Configuration structures for multi-db support
- `replica_factory.go` - Factory pattern for creating replica clients
- `connection_pool.go` - Dynamic connection pooling
- `shared_resources.go` - Shared resource management
- `write_detector.go` - Write-based hot/cold detection
- `db_dynamic.go` - Dynamic database lifecycle management
- `metrics_aggregated.go` - Hierarchical metrics implementation

**Test Files:**
- All corresponding `*_test.go` files
- Tests pass successfully (5.736s)

### Benefits of Consolidation
- Clean separation between core Litestream and multi-db extensions
- All multi-db code in one package (`litestreampp`)
- Easy to understand project structure
- Maintains full compatibility with core Litestream

## Implementation Status
Phase 4 S3 replication is complete. The system now:
- Creates S3 replicas when databases become hot
- Syncs data continuously while hot
- Performs final sync before demotion to cold
- Properly manages replica lifecycle
