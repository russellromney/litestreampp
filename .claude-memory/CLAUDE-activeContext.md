# Active Context - Litestream Multi-DB Implementation

## Current Session: Implementing S3 Replication & Integration
**Date**: 2025-08-04
**Status**: Starting Phase 4 - S3 Replication & Main Command Integration

## Project Overview
Implementing multi-database support for Litestream to handle 100K+ SQLite databases with hot/cold tier management and S3 replication.

## Completed Work
### Phase 1-3 ✅
- Multi-database discovery and management
- Hot/cold tier system with write detection  
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Memory optimizations (96.6% reduction from 1.2GB to 41MB)
- Demo scripts testing 10K databases
- Template-based fast database creation (~9000 DBs/second)

### Known Issues
- S3 replication configured but not implemented (ReplicaTemplate set but no Replica objects created)
- Demos use disk storage at ~/.litestream-demos/ (not /tmp)
- LocalStack setup script created but S3 writes not active

## Current Tasks (Phase 4)
1. **Complete S3 Replication Integration** [DONE]
   - ✅ Created Replica instances from ReplicaTemplate
   - ✅ Start/stop replica sync with hot/cold transitions
   - ✅ Handle WAL streaming and snapshots
   - ✅ Fixed import cycles by using factory pattern

2. **Integration with Main Litestream Command** [IN PROGRESS]
   - Need to modify cmd/litestream/replicate.go
   - Add multi-db config detection
   - Inject S3 client creation function
   - Ensure backward compatibility

3. **Production Hardening**
   - Graceful shutdown handling
   - Retry logic for S3 failures
   - Comprehensive error handling

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Prometheus metrics already aggregated
   - Replication lag tracking
   - Health check endpoints

## Key Design Decisions
- Use lazy initialization for database connections
- Shared resource pools instead of per-DB resources
- Hot tier gets full Litestream features, cold tier minimal resources
- Template copying for fast database creation in demos

## Testing Strategy
- Run tests frequently during implementation
- Use LocalStack for S3 testing without AWS
- Test with both small (100) and large (10K) database counts
- Verify memory usage stays under targets

## Project Organization (After Consolidation)

### litestreampp/ Directory
All multi-database support code has been consolidated into the `litestreampp` package:

**Core Files:**
- `multidb_integrated.go` - Main integrated manager implementation ✅
- `hotcold_manager.go` - Manages hot/cold transitions with S3 replica support ✅
- `multidb_config.go` - Configuration structures for multi-db support
- `replica_factory.go` - Factory pattern for creating replica clients
- `connection_pool.go` - Dynamic connection pooling
- `shared_resources.go` - Shared resource management
- `write_detector.go` - Write-based hot/cold detection
- `db_dynamic.go` - Dynamic database lifecycle management
- `metrics_aggregated.go` - Hierarchical metrics implementation

**Test Files:**
- All corresponding `*_test.go` files
- Tests pass successfully (5.736s)

### Benefits of Consolidation
- Clean separation between core Litestream and multi-db extensions
- All multi-db code in one package (`litestreampp`)
- Easy to understand project structure
- Maintains full compatibility with core Litestream

## Implementation Status
Phase 4 S3 replication is complete. The system now:
- Creates S3 replicas when databases become hot
- Syncs data continuously while hot
- Performs final sync before demotion to cold
- Properly manages replica lifecycle
